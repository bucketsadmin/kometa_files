    summary: A fan edit that combines The Hobbit trilogy into one film that is as close as possible to J.R.R. Tolkien’s book while also matching better with The Lord of the Rings films. Sideplots and characters have been re-edited or removed, which also helps keep the audience more engaged in Bilbo’s adventure.
